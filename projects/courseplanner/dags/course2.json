The class has a lot of memorization and the midterm marks aren\u2019t usually great because people don\u2019t expect how hard it is. The final is easier than the midterm.

The course will also include relevant research papers that introduce both classical and state-of-the-art research in the field. The course will give an overview of the program analyses that work and those that do not work in practice and how to design program analyses for modern software systems. Prerequisites: CMPUT 201 or 275, and CMPUT 272. Knowledge of grammars and automata, regular expressions, and finite state machines is recommended."

This course covers a variety of learning scenarios (supervised, unsupervised and partially supervised), as well as foundational methods for regression, classification, dimensionality reduction and modeling. Techniques such as kernels, optimization and probabilistic graphical models will typically be introduced. It will also provide the formal foundations for understanding when learning is possible and practical. Prerequisites: one of CMPUT 340 or 418; one of STAT 141, 151, 235 or 265 or SCI 151; or consent of the instructor."

This will involve first identifying the task itself, then iteratively addressing relevant issues (typically with feedback from a domain expert), leading to an implementation and culminating in evaluating that system. Students will also learn about best practices in organizing team projects, as well as important information about effective communication. Prerequisites: CMPUT 267, 365, and 366."

How do biological systems represent and process information at the level of single neurons? How is this information processed at the level of small neural networks? How this information is used to control body movements. Given the interdisciplinary nature of this course, we will ensure that students first learn the fundamental concepts of other the disciplines before they are applied. Prerequisites: one of PHYSL 372, PMCOL 371, PEDS 302, CMPUT 340, or consent of instructor. Credit may be obtained in only one of CMPUT 470 or NEURO 496."
