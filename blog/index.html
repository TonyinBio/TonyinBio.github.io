      <h2>First Project</h2>
      <p>
        I first got introduced to coding from my previous attempt to learn
        python in the summer a while ago. I didn't stick with it though and
        got quickly bored because there was no interactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, I learned a bit of R in science research club. That was much
        more interesting to me because I could create cool looking
        visualizations with data and make stat tests-- which normally take a
        long time to carry out-- in one line of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now after joining IMINSA, I am learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JS
        to create a visualization of the courses in my university. I started
        by going to Khan Academy and learning HTML and some JS DOM
        manipulation. After an hour or so I got bored so I just started
        looking up how to create a tech tree and a drag and drop game because
        I wanted my course visualization to be interactive so that you could
        create a draft schedule inside the program. I soon realized that the
        tech trees I was planning on making would not work out because they
        were a type of graph called binary trees which do not allow for a
        node, or course in this case, to have multiple parents, or
        prerequisites.

      <p>
        It turns out that what I'm looking for is a directed acyclic graph or
        DAG. These are graphs that can have multiple parents but the nodes are
        connected in such a way that a cycle cannot form. And after some
        searching, I found a nice library called
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph">Force-Graph</a>
        by Vasutriano. The creator nicely made some examples which I stitched
        together to make the graph you can find in the projects section.

      <p>
        Recently I actually started thinking about the title of the library
        and realized that Force Graph refers to the method of drawing the
        graph; it simulates the nodes as particles and uses repulsive
        <em>forces</em>
        between nodes and balances it with the attractive forces between
        linked nodes to find the most optimal positioning of nodes. However,
        there are many other methods of drawing graphs. There seems to be a
        lot of theory behind many of them, but I am aware of a good method for
        DAGs known as a layered graph or the Sugiyama method. Dagre is a JS
        library that I believe draws graphs using this method, but this
        library is a lot harder to use than the one made by Vasutriano and I
        am still in the process of figuring out all the problems.

        Next, I plan on improving the website by using sticky position to mimic the plants vs zombies credits.
        I also want to recreate the pocket trains game.
